# chatjs

Demo chat running on Llama2

### 1. Setup

Run the installer (tested on Linux and MacOS)

```
$ ./install.sh
```

> The install script compiles the llama2.cpp application and downloads the Llama2 13B chat model, so it is going to take some time and make sure your system has a compiler available

### 2. Run the app

```
$ npm install --production
$ npm start
```

## Usage

Open browser at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000) and start chatting!
